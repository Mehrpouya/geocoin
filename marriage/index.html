  Some notes:
  * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
  * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
  * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
  * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

    <p><strong><u>Get Married</u></strong>
      and record your short-term bitcoin union in blockchain matrimony to join and share bitcoin wallets for a short duration only. Why?

      To explore how we may negotiate roles and values in new forms of short-term partnerships or smart contracts in the future. This location-based bitcoin prototype questions traditional forms of legal contracts currently governing our relation and partnerships. And it considers new opportunities in smart contracting technology and location-based economic services.
    </p>
    <p><strong><u>To dissolve your marriage, </u></strong>
      you just have to wait 5 minutes (or click the divorce button). Your marriage and its dissolution will automatically be recorded as transaction in the pavilion's printed ledger of marriages.
    </p>
    <p><strong><u>Disclaimer</u></strong>
      This is a speculative prototype and no contractually binding marriages are or will take place.
      This app is based on your phone's location services so may not always be accurate.
    </p>
    <p><strong><u>Designed by:</u></strong>
      The concept of this app was developed collaboratively as part of the Blockchain City workshop at the Citylab conference in Amsterdam. Faciliated by Chris Speed, Larissa Pschetz and Dave Murray-Rust the concept was developed by James Stewart, Max Dovey and Corina Angheloiu based on code written by Hadi Mehrpouya and designed by Bettina Nissen.
